[Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6Aj2BYqklg)

niinii (knee-knee) is a graphical frontend for glossing Japanese text. Useful
for assisted reading of text for language learning purposes. A primary use case
is glossing visual novels, which is shown in the demonstration above. I made
this tool with the express intent to read a single *specific* visual novel,
which is also where the name comes from. If someone else finds it useful that's
cool too.

For example, in the demonstration above, I use niinii along with a text hooker
to gloss the dialogue in a visual novel. The segmented phrase along with ruby
text (i.e. furigana) is displayed. Hovering over a segment will show dictionary
definitions and inflections from JMDict. You can pop open a separate window by
clicking on a segment. Hovering over kanji will show kanji information from
KANJIDIC2. I would write a more detailed user manual but I think you can
probably figure it out.

Japanese language support is implemented using
[Ichiran](https://github.com/tshatrov/ichiran) by
[tshatrov](https://github.com/tshatrov). Ichiran is pretty amazing at text 
segmentation compared to other tools I've tried.

## Why not use...
This is a tool created to service a personal need, and may not be useful to you.
Below, I laid out my personal justification for investing time into creating
this tool. If you agree, then this tool may be useful for you.

**Why not use MeCab, JParser, ChaSen, Jisho etc.?**: In my experience ichiran is
much better at segmentation, provides more metadata, and makes fewer mistakes.

**Why not use rikai(kun|chan), JGlossator?**: They don't do segmentation.

**Why not use DeepL, Google Translate, etc.?**: I want a gloss, not a
translation tool. If I ever integrate translation features, I'd like to do so in
a way that supplements the gloss rather than dumping text.

**Why not use the web frontend [ichi.moe](https://ichi.moe)?**: 
There are some features I'd like to experiment with to improve the glossing
experience.

## Build

## Known Issues
### Missing characters when rendering (displays as <?>)
ImGui uses a static font atlas for rendering text. niinii bakes an atlas with
only ~3000 of the most common Japanese kanji, because any more and the texture
will become too large. This means all hy≈çgai kanji will not render. In the
future, we can dynamically rebuild the font atlas when encountering new kanji.

### High CPU usage when out of focus
Seems like a problem with winit. niinii is almost always used in the foreground
anyways because of always on top, so I'm not going to bother fixing this.
